# Gold Price Prediction 💰📈

## 📝 Description 
This project aims to predict the price of gold using historical gold price data and a Random Forest Regression model. The dataset contains features related to gold prices, and we will preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## 📊 Dataset 
The dataset used for this project is available in a CSV file named "gold price dataset.csv".

## 🎯 Approach 
1. Importing necessary libraries for data processing and modeling.
2. Data Collection and Processing: Load the dataset, check basic information, handle missing values, and explore correlations.
3. Data Visualization: Construct a heatmap to understand the correlations and check the distribution of gold prices.
4. Data Preprocessing: Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (Y) and further split them into training and test sets.
5. Model Training: Use the Random Forest Regressor with 100 estimators to train the model on the training data.
6. Model Evaluation: Predict gold prices on the test data and evaluate the model's performance using the R squared error metric.
7. Compare Actual vs. Predicted: Plot the actual gold prices and the predicted prices on a graph to visualize the model's performance.
